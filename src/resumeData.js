  aboutme: `I'm a front-end developer with years of experience
I am advanced in using React and Typescript for creating modern single page web applications,
Redux and context API for global state management,
Jest and React testing library for writing unit test,
and node package manager to handle all the dependencies.
I also have hands-on experience in web apps performance optimization. for the styling part,
I'm familiar with using libraries like Bootstrap, 
Material-Ul and I can customize them for different requirements.
I can also build pure CSS styling from scratch.
For the back-end side, I have experience in designing RESTful API using express and MongoDB for the database.
Also, I'm aware of using project management tools like Git, Jira, and Agile methodology of working as well.
